Proposed Solution for a smart kitchen idea

Problem Statement:

Smart Kitchen
A chef decides to start his business in a prime
Downtown (business) area. The real estate cost
was too high and he could afford only a small
place. The reputation of this chef was so good
he had the prospects of 150 – 180 people
having lunch everyday between 12 pm – 2 pm.
The chef felt this was a great business for him.
The chef was advised a strategic model to structure his operations.
✓ Leverage Cloud kitchen services there by releasing more space for dining
✓ Customers need to pre-order their food and also book their table before 11 am
✓ Food needs to be delivered to this place just in time (JIT) for the customers
✓ Except for some canned beverages, nothing else will be there in this place
✓ Also, he has very limited space for the waiting customers
✓ There will also be some serving tables, getting the food ready to be served
The chef needs a hi-tech system that will help him to run his business efficiently.
➢ A mobile APP for ordering food and table reservation will be the top most of his priorities
➢ An intelligent workflow engine that will route the orders to the cloud kitchens and get them back to this dining
place through the delivery boys just in time for the customers as per their reservation slot is also needed
➢ The restaurant supervisor will have an APP to monitor the orders and the in flow of the customers
The chef needs an AI driven technology for achieving the following
➢ Lunch time is limited to 2 hours and he may not be able to serve all the people within the 2 hours. So the chef
has planned for delivery at door step so that he doesn’t loose the business. The mobile APP should have built-in
intelligence to impress the customers for a delivery when the demand is high for dining.
➢ To start with each table reservation would be given a 40 min slot. However there should be a mechanism to
collect the data on the actual time taken vs kind of food so that this time slot can be optimized in the future.
